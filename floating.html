<!-- 01. A simple use of the float property -->
<p>In the paragraph below, we have added an image with style <b>float:right</b>. The result is that the image will float to the right in the paragraph.</p>

<!-- 02. An image with border and margins that floats to the right in a paragraph -->
<p>In the paragraph below, the image will float to the right. A dotted black border is added to the image. 
We have also added margins to the image to push the text away from the image:
0 px margin on the top and right side, 15 px margin on the bottom, and 20 px margin on the left side of the image.

<p>
In the paragraph above, the div element is 120 pixels wide and it contains the image.
The div element will float to the right. Margins are added to the div to push the text away from the div.
Borders and padding are added to the div to frame in the picture and the caption.

<p>
In the paragraph above, the first letter of the text is embedded in a span element.
The span element has a width that is 0.7 times the size of the current font.
The font-size of the span element is 400% (quite large) and the line-height is 80%.
The font of the letter in the span will be in "Algerian".

<!-- 05. Create side-by-side images -->
<h2>Images Side by Side</h2>
<p>Float images side by side:</p>

<div class="clearfix">
  <div class="img-container">
    <img src="img_5terre.jpg" alt="Italy" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  <div class="img-container">
    <img src="img_forest.jpg" alt="Forest" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  <div class="img-container">
    <img src="img_mountains.jpg" alt="Mountains" style="width:100%">
  </div>
</div>

<p>Note that we also use the clearfix hack to take care of the layout flow, and that add the box-sizing property to make sure that the image container doesn't break due to extra padding. Try to remove this code to see the effect.</p>
